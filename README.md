### 🔬 My experience
I have been building scalable Node/React applications remotely (from 🇬🇧, lived in 🇨🇴, currently in Miami, 🇺🇸) for the last 6 years. Successfully helped launch two FinTech startups (Fundstack - now <a href="https://attio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attio</a> and <a href="https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moneyfarm</a> and joined as engineer #8 at Maze (now ~40).
