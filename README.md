### Hi, I'm Henry 👋

I'm a software engineer, ex-investment consultant, notes hoarder and long term traveller.

### ⚡️ Current
I am currently a Senior Full Stack Engineer at [Maze](https://maze.co/) where I help build the future of product discovery for user-centric teams.

### 🔬 My experience
I have been building scalable Node/React applications remotely (from 🇬🇧, lived in 🇨🇴) for the last 4 years. Successfully helped launch two FinTech startups (Fundstack - now [Attio](https://attio.com/) and [Moneyfarm](https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/)). I am a CFA charterholder and I speak Spanish to DELE level B2.
