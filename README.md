### Hi, I'm Henry 👋

I'm a software engineer, ex-investment consultant, notes hoarder and long term traveller.

### ⚡️ Current
I am currently a Senior Full Stack Engineer at <a href="https://maze.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maze</a> where I help build the future of product discovery for user-centric teams.

### 🔬 My experience
I have been building scalable Node/React applications remotely (from 🇬🇧, lived in 🇨🇴, currently in Miami, 🇺🇸) for the last 6 years. Successfully helped launch two FinTech startups (Fundstack - now <a href="https://attio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attio</a> and <a href="https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moneyfarm</a>) and joined as engineer #8 at Maze (now ~40). I am a CFA charterholder and I speak Spanish to DELE level B2.
